#for loops, two kinds, to iterate through the list

#Assignment 1:
#Use a for loop to print out the odd indices of a list



#use randint to pick a random item from list




#Assignment 2:
#This program will print a random name by choosing two words randomly from a list.
#starter code



#Assignment 3: 
#This program will iterate over a list of numbers
#create a new list with all the numbers that are multiples of 5
#and print the new list and the sum of all elements in that list.
#starter code
